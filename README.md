# BotWars2

BotWars is a game designed for a hackathon or team building event built on top of the original [BotWars game](https://github.com/davidseanlittlewood/BeatTheBotsServer). Teams compete to program their ultimate fighting machines, Each team should be made up of multi-disciplied people who do not work together day to day and should be equiped with a computer, a copy of the instruction books, the VanillaBot solution, and large amounts of pizza.

## Why run BotWars?

BotWars is a great (and fun) way to bring together people from different disciplines and from different teams. If you're in any doubt here's some feedback from people who took part in our event:

* It was great as a business person to get fully involved in the hackathon, as it's not always a guarantee if you haven't got the coding skills! It was a great problem to digest in the short space of an afternoon and good to meet people from other areas of the business.
* Opportunity to work with colleagues from other teams in a fun engaging environment
* Getting together with colleagues having never worked with before, food, drinks and laughter of bots "fighting" each other.
* The light heartedness of the event and getting the opportunity to work with new people
* It allowed people to work with people they would possibly never normally speak to or see, creating better bonds and relationships within the company. It also promoted creative problem solving skills while keeping the subject fun and lighthearted allowing non-coders to be involved also

## How to run BotWars

Running a BotWars event is easy. You need half a day, a quiet space, and a group of people.

We recommend teams of four or five people, each one seeded with a developer. One of the huge motivations for running a BotWars event is to meet and work alongside new people so we recommend randomising the other team members. Names in a hat is a tried and tested method.

Each of your teams should have a laptop, a copy of the rules, and the [BotExample solution](https://github.com/ardliath/BotWars2Client) (assuming you're working in .NET). We also recommend a selection of pens and squared paper. As the organisor you will need a copy of the BattleOfTheBots application running on your computer.

Rounds can be randomised but we recommend:

* 45 minutes to create the first version of your bots
* Round 1, all competitors and the easy house bots
* 45 minutes tinker time
* Round 2, all competitors and the harder house bots
* 45 minutes tinker time
* Round 3, all competitors
* Round 4, the top three scoring competitors to decide an overall winner

The scores for rounds 1, 2, and 3 are cumulative so it's better to have a very simple bot in each round than no bot at all.

## Technical Suggestions

* Make sure your teams are running the bot solution as an administrator, it helps with the permissions for the HttpListener class
* Make sure each team can connect in the initial 45 minutes tinker time, you don't want technical problems spoiling your first round
